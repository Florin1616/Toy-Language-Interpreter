## Description
This project is a toy language interpreter developed in Java with a graphical user interface built using JavaFX, following the Model-View-Controller architecture. It supports a range of operations, including arithmetic, logical, and relational expressions, as well as file operations and multithreaded control statements.
The primary goal of this project is to offer insights into the execution flow of a program, from parsing through to execution.

## Features
- **Expression Handling**: Supports arithmetic, logical, and relational expressions.
- **Statements**: Implements various statements, including assignment, conditional (`if`), loops (`while`), and file operations.
- **Type System**: Manages different data types like integers, booleans, strings, and references.
- **Heap and Stack Management**: Custom ADTs for managing memory and execution context.
- **GUI**: Interactive JavaFX interface for inputting code, executing it, and viewing the output.
